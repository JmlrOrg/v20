\noindent Dear JMLR editors,
\\

Thank you for considering reviewing our paper. This paper presents an
extended version of the 2015 KDD submission ``Adaptation Algorithm and
Theory Based on Generalized Discrepancy''. This version includes new
learning guarantees based on the Rademacher complexity and a tighter
measure of discrepancy. More importantly, we are including a more
extensive empirical evaluation of our algorithm.
\\

All authors of this paper are aware of the current submission. In
order to better assess conflicts of interest, we want to bring to the
editors attention that all authors have worked closely with people at
Google Research.

This submission is for the special topic on Multi-Task Learning, Domain Adaptation and Transfer Learning.
\\

*We have modified the title from our original submission to
``Adaptation Based on Generalized Discrepancy'' to avoid conflicts
with our previous KDD submission. 
\\

\noindent Best regards, \\
