    "abstract": "We present a novel framework for learning with sequential data of any kind, such as multivariate time series, strings, or sequences of graphs. The main result is a ''sequentialization'' that transforms any kernel on a given domain into a kernel for sequences in that domain. This procedure preserves properties such as positive definiteness, the associated kernel feature map is an ordered variant of sample (cross-)moments, and this sequentialized kernel is consistent in the sense that it converges to a kernel for paths if sequences converge to paths (by discretization). Further, classical kernels for sequences arise as special cases of this method. We use dynamic programming and low-rank techniques for tensors to provide efficient algorithms to compute this sequentialized kernel.",
