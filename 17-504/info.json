    "abstract": "In this paper, the problem of one-bit compressed sensing (OBCS) is formulated as a problem in probably approximately correct (PAC) learning. It is shown that the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC-) dimension of the set of half-spaces in $\\R^n$ generated by $k$-sparse vectors is bounded below by $k ( \\lfloor\\lg (n/k) \\rfloor +1 )$ and above by $\\lfloor 2k \\lg (en) \\rfloor $. By coupling this estimate with well-established results in PAC learning theory, we show that a consistent algorithm can recover a $k$-sparse vector with $O(k \\lg n)$ measurements, given only the signs of the measurement vector. This result holds for \\textit{all} probability measures on $\\R^n$. The theory is also applicable to the case of noisy labels, where the signs of the measurements are flipped with some unknown probability.",
