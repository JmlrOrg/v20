    "abstract": "We consider stochastic settings for clustering, and develop provably-good approximation algorithms for a number of these notions. These algorithms yield better approximation ratios compared to the usual deterministic clustering setting. Additionally, they offer a number of advantages including clustering which is fairer and has better long-term behavior for each user. In particular, they ensure that every user is guaranteed to get good service (on average). We also complement some of these with impossibility results.",
