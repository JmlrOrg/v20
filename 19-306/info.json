    "abstract": "We study the problem of sampling from a strongly log-concave density supported on $\\mathbb{R}^d$, and prove a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mixing time of the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA). The method draws samples by simulating a Markov chain obtained from the discretization of an appropriate Langevin diffusion, combined with an accept-reject step. Relative to known guarantees for the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), our bounds show that the use of an accept-reject step in MALA leads to an exponentially improved dependence on the error-tolerance. Concretely, in order to obtain samples with TV error at most $\\delta$ for a density with condition number $\\kappa$, we show that MALA requires $\\mathcal{O} (\\kappa d \\log(1/\\delta) )$ steps from a warm start, as compared to the $\\mathcal{O} (\\kappa^2 d/\\delta^2 )$ steps established in past work on ULA. We also demonstrate the gains of a modified version of MALA over ULA for weakly log-concave densities. Furthermore, we derive mixing time bounds for the Metropolized random walk (MRW) and obtain $\\mathcal{O}(\\kappa)$ mixing time slower than MALA. We provide numerical examples that support our theoretical findings, and demonstrate the benefits of Metropolis-Hastings adjustment for Langevin-type sampling algorithms.",
