    "abstract": "Pyro is a probabilistic programming language built on Python as a platform for developing advanced probabilistic models in AI research. To scale to large data sets and high-dimensional models, Pyro uses stochastic variational inference algorithms and probability distributions built on top of PyTorch, a modern GPU-accelerated deep learning framework. To accommodate complex or model-specific algorithmic behavior, Pyro leverages Poutine, a library of composable building blocks for modifying the behavior of probabilistic programs.",
